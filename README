cec_yamaha_power
----------------
This project is very specific to my home theater setup. It is
intentionally not a general purpose mechanism and solves my very
specific problem.

cec_yamaha_power uses a PulseEight USB-CEC Adapter to monitor the CEC
bus between a source device and a TV to control the power and scene of
a Yamaha HTR-6230 reciever. When it hears the ACTIVE_SOURCE opcode it
turns on the reciever and activates Scene 1; when it hears the STANDBY
opcode it turns the reciever off. The IR remote control logic is
implemented on an Arduino Nano Every connected to the i2c bus of a
Raspberry Pi (see the i2c_remote directory).

The program is intended to be used as init for a minimal buildroot
based Linux image (see https://github.com/jsouthworth/cec_yamaha_power_build).
